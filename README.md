# **Escape Protocol - Scripts**

## **Overview**
This repository contains all necessary scripts for the Unity game, *Escape Protocol*. *Escape Protocol* is a casual game that simulates "Cops & Robbers," integrating an XGBoost Classifier machine learning algorithm to evaluate player performance each round and determine how to adjust the game's difficulty through changing the enemy agents' AI. These scripts control player mechanics, define the enemy AI behavior, and manage the flow of each level. Included also are the Python scripts necessary to create the training dataset and algorithm model used for difficulty evaluation.
